# üìä Stock Price Forecasting with CEEMDAN‚ÄìCNN‚ÄìLSTM  
*A Data-Driven Business Intelligence Project for Financial Decision Support*  

This repository showcases an **individual project** where I built a hybrid deep learning model to forecast major Vietnam stock indices.  
By combining **signal decomposition (CEEMDAN)** with **deep learning (CNN‚ÄìLSTM)**, the project demonstrates how advanced analytics can deliver **accurate, actionable insights** for investors and financial institutions.

## üéØ Business Motivation
Financial markets are highly volatile, and **poor forecasting increases risk exposure**.  
Investors and portfolio managers need reliable insights to:  
- Anticipate market movements  
- Manage risk effectively  
- Optimize investment decisions  

This project addresses that need by delivering **predictive analytics** that reduce forecast errors and improve confidence in decision-making.

## üîç Project Objectives
1. **Build a predictive model** that can handle noisy, non-linear financial time series.  
2. **Evaluate forecasting accuracy** using standard error metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE).  
3. **Generate business-relevant insights** for investment strategy and risk management.

## üìä Data
- **Source**: VNStock API  
- **Period**: Sep 2017 ‚Äì Oct 2024  
- **Indices analyzed**: VNINDEX, VN30, HNXINDEX, HNX30, UPCOMINDEX  
- **Features**: Daily open, close, high, low, and trading volume

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Cleaning: handled missing values and outliers  
- Normalization: standardized input features for model stability  

### 2. Signal Decomposition (CEEMDAN)  
- Broke down raw stock index series into stable components (IMFs + residuals)  
- Reduced noise, highlighted true market patterns  

### 3. Hybrid Modeling (CNN + LSTM)  
- **CNN**: detected short-term fluctuations in IMFs  
- **LSTM**: captured long-term temporal dependencies  
- Combined forecasts to reconstruct full signal  

### 4. Evaluation Metrics  
- RMSE, MAE, MAPE ‚Äì standard for financial forecasting models
